# ---------------------------------------------
# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Application
Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run algoviz/app.py
```
The application will start and open in your default web browser.
# ---------------------------------------------
# Using the Application
## General Controls
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose the type of algorithm and specific algorithm to visualize
- **Visualization Controls**:
  - Play/Pause: Start or pause the animation
  - Step Forward: Move one step forward in the algorithm
  - Step Backward: Move one step backward
  - Reset: Reset the visualization to the beginning
  - Speed Control: Adjust animation speed (Slow, Medium, Fast)
  - Fullscreen: Toggle fullscreen mode for better viewing
## Graph Algorithms
1. **Setup**:
   - Choose graph creation mode (Automatic or Manual)
   - For automatic mode, adjust nodes and edge density
   - For manual mode, use the graph editor tools
2. **Graph Editor Tools**:
   - Select: Select elements in the graph
   - Add Node: Click in empty space to add a new node
   - Add Edge: Select source node, then target node, and enter weight
   - Delete: Remove nodes or edges by clicking on them
   - Reset Graph: Clear the entire graph
3. **Start Node Selection**:
   - For algorithms like Dijkstra's, select the starting node
4. **Visualization**:
   - The upper right panel shows current steps
   - The lower right panel provides explanations
   - Different colors indicate:
     - Orange: Currently visited nodes
     - Blue: Current node being processed
     - Green: Completed paths
     - Red: Backtracking
## Sorting Algorithms
1. **Setup**:
   - Choose array size and generation method
2. **Visualization**:
   - Each step in the sorting process is visualized
   - Colors indicate:
     - Orange: Pivot element (for QuickSort)
     - Yellow: Elements being compared
     - Purple: Elements being swapped
     - Green: Sorted elements
# ---------------------------------------------
# Features in Detail
## Explanation Panels
- **Current Step**: Shows what's happening in the current step
- **Explanation**: Provides reasoning and details about the current operation
## Graph Creation
- **Automatic**: Creates a random graph with specified parameters
- **Manual**: Build your own graph with nodes and weighted edges
## Visualization Navigation
- Use the control panel to navigate through algorithm steps
- Zoom controls allow zooming in/out and resetting the view
## Performance Settings
- Adjust animation speed to see algorithms at different paces
- Fullscreen mode for better visibility
